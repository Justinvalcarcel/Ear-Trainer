Ear-Trainer
===========

Ear Training Program

Written with Python 3.4.1 on Windows 7 
GUI created with TKinter

This is a simple ear-training program. To start, you just press "Play Notes" and the base note will play followed by another randomly generated note. It is your job to guess what interval between those two notes are. You can hit "Play Now" as many times as you'd like and it will keep repeating those two intervals.

If you decide you want to skip to a new interval simply hit the "New Interval" button.

Your score is kept at the bottom of the program and you can reset it from the File menu.

The program starts off with the Even Temperament Scale (the basis of 99% of the music you hear today) in the key of C. You can change the key as well as the scale. Keep in mind that that all three scales will sound pretty similar and that if you're not sure which one to pick, you should stick with the Even Temperament Scale.

This can only be run on Windows at the moment, but I am working on porting it to Mac.
